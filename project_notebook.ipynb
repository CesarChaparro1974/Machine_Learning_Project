    "### DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:<BR>\n",
    " Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.<BR>\n",
    "\n",
    " I have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans.<BR>\n",
    " \n",
    " For this classification task, I need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since Iâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, I can move straight to creating the model.  "
